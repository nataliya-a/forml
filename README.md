## How to run the code

To run the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following commands:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

To run the backend, navigate to the `backend` directory and run the following commands:

```bash
cd backend
flask --app main run
```

(make sure you have the `flask` command installed. It's also recommended to use a virtual environment.)
